# Tensorflow-implementations

TF implementations various Deep Learning algorithms.

All of the pre-tained networks used in my project are not mine and some of the code snippets (sone functions like plotting images etc.) are taken from online resources like "stackoverflow" and "github". Forgive me, I cannot provide links to all these code snippets. Because I don't have those pages' links.

Some of the codes need more documentation, please forgive me for this as well. I could not find more time to update them, as I become more professional, I will improve the level of documentation in my programs.
